# Change Log

- Preprocessed data for the remaining states with 7 or more congressional districts.
- Re-generated simplified shapes for MD.
- New simplified shape threshold verified for NC and NC to match DRA compactness measurements.
- Mods to get the code running again, so I could track down simplified shape arcs not being symmetric.
