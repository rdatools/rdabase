WORKFLOW
--------

(1) Unzip the census and election files in the local clone of vtd_data.
    Rename them '2020_census_{xx}.csv' and '2020_election_{xx}.csv', respectively.

(2) Create a config file for the state, modeled on 'XX_2020_config.json'.
    Save it in the 'data/{xx}/' directory.
    Make sure the fields in the 'elections' property list the elections used in the composite.

(3) Run the preprocessing scripts (but don't generate a graph which already exists):

    scripts/preprocess_state.py -s {xx} --zipped --nograph
